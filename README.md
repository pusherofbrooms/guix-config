# Guix configs for Lenovo IdeaPad

This is my system and home config for my laptop using:

 * nonguix for wifi
 * sddm for login
 * xfce and sway (I'm new to tiling wm's)

I used the instructions from [SystemCrafters](https://wiki.systemcrafters.net/guix/nonguix-installation-guide/) to install on the laptop.
